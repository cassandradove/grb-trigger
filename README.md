<h1>GRB Detection Algorithm for Background and Transient Observer</h1>
<p>This code contains a work in progress of a simulation to test different algorithms for detecting gamma-ray bursts on BTO.</p>
<p>Currently, you can run sim.py in command line to see a customizable simulation of gamma ray bursts with a simple terminal user interface</p>
